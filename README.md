### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
-i have work with the svg content for the first time, i learned how to make it scalable.
-i also learned that every browser has its specific default layout sizes.
-i learn to use the box shadow for the first time. 



### Continued development

-i am really not comfortable yet in the best practise of useing css properties, as well as use a coherent yet meaningful name conventions.
-i am not comfortable with using @import properties.
-My code need to be more organized and more clear

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39056537/why-don-t-svg-images-scale-using-the-css-width-property) - This helped me for to understand that when you set a width in the svg declaration code you will not be able to change it later in the css code reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
